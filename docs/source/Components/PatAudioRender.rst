PatAudioRender
============================================================

| This component is responsible for the audio rendering within Unity. It is assigned a PatActor to use as its render source.
| Once assigned to a particular actor, this runs automatically based on audio availability coming from the PatAsset.
| If used outside of the PatAsset prefab, the component requires that a Unity AudioSource is attached to the same object.
