TriggerHvrActor
=======================

    Can be used in conjunction with a Projector component to project a texture onto a surface based on the bounds of an HvrActor. This is useful for creating blob shadows.

How to Create
-------------

    1. Select (or create) a Unity GameObject
    2. Click on ‘Add Component’ in the inspector
    3. Go to ‘8i/HvrActorProjectorShadow’
    4. Slot the HvrActor and Audiosource into the component. From now on the audio source will match the playback time of the HvrActor.
