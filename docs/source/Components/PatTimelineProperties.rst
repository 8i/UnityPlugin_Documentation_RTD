PatTimelineProperties
============================================================

- TimelineActive: This is a global property that is automatically switched ON when a PatActor AssetTrack is created. This switches PatRender/PatAudioRender behaviors such that they can be controlled from the Timeline, rather than with the standard Unity lifecycle.
