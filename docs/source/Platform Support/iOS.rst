Building for iOS
----------------

    When building for iOS, there are a few things to be noted.

    * Use a Mac to generate the iOS build
    * Switch the build target to iOS in 'Build Settings' dialogue
    * In 'Player Settings' dialogue, uncheck 'Auto Graphics API', move and make sure 'OpenGLES3' is on the top of Graphics API list. Metal is not currently supported.
