Building for iOS
----------------

    When building for iOS, there are a few things to be noted.

    * A Mac is required to generate the iOS xcode project
    * Metal is not a supportd GraphicsAPI. In 'Player Settings' dialogue, uncheck 'Auto Graphics API', move and make sure 'OpenGLES3' is on the top of Graphics API list.
